# Changelog

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-02

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-01

- Renamed default output directory from `output/` to `objects/`
- Output filenames now use full page title slugged with dashes, prefixed by org abbreviation from `orgs.json` config (e.g., `ctd-employer-partners-apprentice-facing.json`)
- Added `orgs.json` to map Airtable app IDs to org name, abbreviation, and excluded fields
- Added per-source field exclusion via `exclude_fields` in `orgs.json` (e.g., drop `Attachments` column for employer partners)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-01
